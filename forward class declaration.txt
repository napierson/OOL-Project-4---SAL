// Simple declaration
class Machine;

// Now write your other classes
class Instruction {
    // blablabla
};

// Other classes here
class Machine {
    // blablabla
};

You classes depend on each other so since one is not defined at the time the other is referencing it, the error shows up. For above code, the Instruction class needs to know about the Machine class before using it.

Use forward declaration for Machine class like below:

 

class Machine;

Class Instruction{

     void  func(Machine TM);

 

}

 

class Machine{  

    vector<Instruction*> List;

}
